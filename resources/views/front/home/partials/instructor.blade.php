            <p class="mt-8">
                By moving common functionalities to packages, the codebase of your apps can become smaller and more
                maintainable.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4">
                Packages can have their own testsuite. When a bug is discovered, you can easily distribute the fix in
                your apps by merely running <code class="opacity-75 text-lg bg-white rounded p-1">composer update</code>.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4">
                There are commercial benefits as well. By open sourcing packages, you as a developer, and your company
                become much more visible in the community, which can lead to interesting opportunities coming your way.
